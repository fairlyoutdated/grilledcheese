# Grilled Cheese
'Grilled Cheese' is a video game about grilled cheese sandwiches. 

## Synopsis
You are a grilled cheese, in a pan, cooking like usual. Next to your pan is another pan containing another grilled cheese; your significant other. You both live your life happily until that significant other is taken hostage and eaten by a horrible human being. You are devastated, and you feel like life won't be as joyous as it previously was. Can you do anything about it? No, of course not, you're a grilled cheese, for frick's sake. Or can you? You decide to hop onto the unknown floor and gather as many bacteria as possible, hoping these would make the human who is obviously going to eat you sick. Is this too intense for frickin' grilled cheeses? **Yes, absolutely**.
